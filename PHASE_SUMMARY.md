# Phase Summary — RL Threshold Tuning + Retrained Model (2025-10-24)

This document summarizes everything implemented and verified in this phase. It replaces scattered notes and reflects the current working state of the project.

## 1) Overview

- Added a production-ready Reinforcement Learning (RL) module to learn per-intent confidence thresholds online.
- Retrained the PhoBERT intent model with augmented data focusing on weak intents.
- Integrated RL into the NLP pipeline, added monitoring endpoints and a terminal dashboard.
- Cleaned the repository to keep only what is necessary for this phase; replaced README and added CHANGELOG.

## 2) Key Changes

- RL Threshold Tuner (app/services/rl_threshold_tuner.py)
  - Contextual epsilon-greedy with UCB1 bonus; arms are thresholds in [0.80..0.95].
  - Epsilon decay with floor, persistent state at models/rl_threshold_state.json.
  - API: select threshold by intent; update from reward; compute stats/best thresholds.
- NLP Integration (app/services/nlp_service.py)
  - Uses RL-selected threshold during inference; can be toggled by flag.
  - Falls back gracefully if models or services are unavailable.
- Feedback + Monitoring
  - POST /api/feedback/rl-reward (no auth) — record reward and update RL state.
  - GET /api/feedback/rl-stats (auth) — consolidated stats.
  - RL Monitor router (/api/rl-monitor/*):
    - /status — epsilon, pulls, exploration ratio, etc. (fixed epsilon_min/min_epsilon mismatch)
    - /thresholds — best threshold per intent
    - additional exploration/performance endpoints when enabled
- Model Retraining
  - Script: manual_train.py (no Trainer/Accelerator dependency).
  - Data: data/extended_dataset_v2.csv (+ data/augmented_weak_intents.csv for transparency).
  - Results: Train Acc ≈ 97.9%, Val Acc 100% (small val); weak intents improved.
  - model_manager.py: default to latest retrained path (waterfall → v3 → old classifier).
- Tests & Tools
  - quick_test.py: sanity of / and RL monitoring endpoints.
  - test_retrained_model.py: direct HF inference on weak intents.
  - test_api_retrained.py: uses FastAPI pipeline with direct model load (fast).
  - test_production.py: E2E sweep against running server.
- Documentation & Cleanup
  - README.md replaced with current instructions.
  - CHANGELOG.md added for this phase.
  - Cleaned old datasets, experimental scripts, unused services, and redundant docs/tests.
  - .gitignore updated to ignore full models/ and transient files.

## 3) Current Endpoints (selected)

- Health: GET `/`
- Calls:
  - POST `/api/calls/webhook` — body: `{ call_id: <UUID in DB>, speech_to_text: "..." }`
- Feedback (RL):
  - POST `/api/feedback/rl-reward` (no auth)
  - GET `/api/feedback/rl-stats` (auth)
- RL Monitor:
  - GET `/api/rl-monitor/status`
  - GET `/api/rl-monitor/thresholds`

Note: Use http://localhost:8000 in the browser (avoid 0.0.0.0).

## 4) Verified Runs (Windows, Python 3.11)

- API server: `python -X utf8 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`
- quick_test.py: `/` 200, RL status/thresholds OK, feedback stats 401 (auth as designed)
- RL status after reward: epsilon decays as expected.
- test_retrained_model.py: overall ≈93.3% on selected weak-intent set; strong confidence on most lines.
- test_api_retrained.py: high-confidence predictions via service; RL threshold selection visible in logs.

## 5) Cleanup Actions

- Removed obsolete datasets: `data/augmented_dataset.csv`, `data/augmented_extended_dataset.csv`, `data/extended_dataset.csv`.
- Removed experimental/duplicate scripts and tests as listed in recent commits (bb94e24, edbf268).
- Removed redundant docs; README now reflects this phase.
- Ignored `models/` entirely in `.gitignore` to prevent large artifacts in VCS.

## 6) Breaking/Notable Changes

- RL Monitor router paths standardized under `/api/rl-monitor/*`.
- Webhook requires `speech_to_text` and real `call_id` in DB.
- `epsilon_min` → uses internal `min_epsilon`; API returns `epsilon_min` field for clients.
- Default model path points to retrained model; ensure model exists locally.

## 7) Next Steps

- Optionally tag a release (e.g., `v1.2.0-rl`) and publish release notes.
- Collect real production feedback for continued RL learning.
- Incrementally augment data from production edge cases (code-mixing, short harsh phrases).
